# Bookshare-Web-Application
Bookshare is a web application built specifically to help students to buy, rent or sell textbooks. Using Bookshare, a student can either buy or rent a textbook by viewing the ads or can play the role of a seller and post an ad of the textbook for sale. Bookshare works in the similar line of Craigslist where any user can advertise his/her book that he wants to sell or lease and users who are interested in these ads can request to get in touch with the advertiser/seller.

Tools Used: Java, HTML5, CSS, XML, JavaScript, JSP, Servlets, AWS Elastic BeanStalk, Amazon RDS Cloud, MySQL
